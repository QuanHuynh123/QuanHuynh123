# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

## ðŸ›  About Me
I'm a passionate **backend developer** with a strong focus on building scalable and efficient web applications. My expertise revolves around **Java**, **Spring Framework**, and database systems, but I'm always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies. 

In addition to backend development, I have experience working with **Android**, a touch of **C++**, and a good grasp of web development basics like **HTML5** and **CSS3**.

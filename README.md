# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

## ðŸ›  About Me  
I'm a motivated **backend development student** with an interest in building web applications. My main focus is on **Java**, **Spring Framework**, and working with databases. I enjoy learning new tools and technologies to improve my skills.  

In addition to backend development, I have some experience with **Android development**, basic knowledge of **C++**, and familiarity with web development technologies like **HTML5** and **CSS3**.  

I'm actively looking for an internship to apply my knowledge, gain practical experience, and grow as a developer.
